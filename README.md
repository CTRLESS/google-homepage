# First Odin Project

Assignment to replicate Google homepage using HTML & CSS.

Had a problem where my browser was forcing a 8px margin around the website. That's when I remembered about the CSS reset. It worked like a charm.

Used the Chrome DevTools to track down and copy the border-shadow and border-color of buttons and search bar.

And, of course, I included the Favicon. It's like the cherry on top.
